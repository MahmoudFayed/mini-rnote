## Main differences and features:

- All tabbed windows has been merged into one group.
- Two rows toolbar.
- Main source file toolbar reduced into one sticky icon in the first toolbar. So that sticked script can be run even other script is being edited.
- Switching to formdesigner tab hides toolbars to increase more space allowed for form designer.
- Prepare Functions and Classes lists at time of switch to their tabs.
- Fixed style and settings (needs to be re-activated soon).
- Disable hash checks for file content differences. (Should be enabled soon)
- Disable menu bar and its related code.
