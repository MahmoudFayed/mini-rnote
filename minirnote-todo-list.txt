To do list for mini rnote IDE for android
============================================

- re enable settings file taking care of paths
- adding icon or menu to edit minirnote settings
- # taking care of main paths of the rnote
- changing the rnote name in the window title and the file name
- comment out RunTool and RunToolConsole funcs and other unused funcs
- delete all/unNecessary commented code
- add ring bins folder to the project.qrc file
- resize font of line numbers panel
- add standard library and other libs
- redesigning the interface for better look
- redisign search window
- 


Main Problems that I faced:
-----------------------------------------
- Compiling ringqt for android to be loaded by android specific Ring binaries.
	== SegFault Error msg when loading compiled libringqt.so by ring from within android emulator.
	Working evnvironment: 
		- Computer: Ubuntu 18.04 64bit + Qt 5.11.0 + QtCreator 4.6.1
		- Android: api=21 arch=arm


Minor tweeks that need to be implemented:
----------------------------------
- make /sdcard/minirnote/ path as a working directory, and put prepared ringlibs dir there.
